just adding features in my own repository so i can actually tell my team i did something
*everything is untested*

- **Driver**
  - X to snap swerve at a 45 degree angle to go over bump
  - LT to switch to optimal speed for bump traversal (might have alr been done with RT for slow mode)
- **Operator**
  - hood control with left stick (Left Y to be precise)
  - Emergency turret control with right stick (Right X)
  - spin shooter flywheel (solee's role)
  - X to intake (just spinning intake motors)
